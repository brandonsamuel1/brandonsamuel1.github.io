## Welcome to My GitHub Page

This is a my one page website that you can view some of my applications that I have been working on.


## YelpCamp

YelpCamp is a application that allows registered users to create campsites by opload a picture of the campsite and share a small description about it. Users can update and delete campsites they have published. They can also comment on other campsites if they find one they really like! Built with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB. Check it out [here](https://fast-woodland-11962.herokuapp.com/)


## Jungle

Jungle is an eCommerce site where users can buy items they have interest in. They can search by categories and expect a safe and secure credit card checkout. Admin users can create new categories. Build with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL. Check it out [here](https://secure-basin-32261.herokuapp.com/)
